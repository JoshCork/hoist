===============================

## Instructions
To play the game just point your browser at the index.html page at the root of this folder. I broke out some of the code in the original app.js into their own javascript files for easy of organization. update.

## Attribution
I used the code examples from this page to give me an idea of how to implement buttons in an HTML 5 Canvas Game.  I had to modified
the code that was presented here in this post as well as work my way through several bugs in the author's post at the time of my reading. Here is the post:

I also modified one of the templates (specifically: cover) from the bootstrap getting started template list for my HTML page. Here's the link:
